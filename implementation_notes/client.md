- When a CPE is linked to the client, the **New Call Ticket** action appears inside the **CPE details** expander; if no CPE is linked, the action will appear below the client details list.
- Selecting an item from the dropdown triggers a focused popup that shows the **Add New Ticket** form for the chosen ticket type. The **ONT ID** is pre-filled, related fields auto-fill, and the form runs in the popup context rather than replacing the Client page.
